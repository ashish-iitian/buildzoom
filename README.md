# predict_real-estate_attributes

As dataset for this project, I had real-world building licenses. The goal was to classify the license types into two classes: "ELECTRICAL" and "NON-ELECTRICAL". I trained and validated my model (logistic-regression) over a dataset of around 100k inputs and tested it over 25k inputs. I used the classifier and feature-extractors from scikit-learn package.
